      <p>     Hello! My name is Corey Meyer(as you have probably found out by now). Before MAX I worked at a company called Quality Gold as a Bench Jeweler.
          The life of a Bench Jeweler is rewarding but has many caviots. I have been programming since I was in middle-school and never thought that I could
          actually make a career out of it due to my lack of formal training. Then I discovered MAX. Affordable enough to be realistic, and quick enough to 
          get me back out into the workforce before I became too hungry. I had prepped for six months leading up to the bootcamp focusing around 200 hours of study
          in core fundimentals of Java and secondarily another 50 hours in assorted languages.
          
              So far, at 9 weeks in, the bootcamp has been pretty relaxed. Homework is probably the hardest part because that is where individuals can really push themselves
          to learn more. In class any struggle that myself or a classmate came accross was easy to alleviate; either by the assistance of our instructor, Greg, or with 
          assistance from our peers. 
              At first we were told that this bootcamp would be "The heardest thing you have ever done." I found this to be untrue. It was MUCH more difficult to learn
          the core concepts of programming on my own through the years than learn what we went over in class. The curriculum seems overwhelming but as long as you
          take it one step at a time, you will be fine... Also do you homework! if(homework==done){student.confusionLevel-=confusion;} else return sadness;
  
              I feel confident that I am set up for success going into Software Development as a career field. I may not have any particularly abnormal specialties to contribute, 
          but I have clear set goals, a foundation of knowledge to add upon. There is only so much that you can learn in 13-14 weeks. So we must continue to be life-long-learners
          if we wish to succeed.
  
      </p>
